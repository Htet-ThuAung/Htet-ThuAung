# 👋 Hey, I'm Htet Thu Aung — but you can call me Veon.

I'm a **Computer Vision Engineer** focused on building AI systems that can *see, understand, and act*. My work bridges deep learning research with practical, real-time computer vision applications.

Recently completed the renowned **CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks** course to sharpen my fundamentals, and have since applied those concepts in production-style projects — including helmet detection and shelf-monitoring systems.

## About Me

Based in Yangon 🇲🇲, I’m building a career in Computer Vision through focused learning, project-based mastery, and deep technical exploration. I value clean code, reproducibility, and solving real-world problems with AI.

I thrive on turning ideas into working systems — and the moment when a model *finally converges* after hours of training? That’s my fuel.
