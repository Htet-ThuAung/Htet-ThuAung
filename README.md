# 👋 Hey there! I'm Htet Thu Aung — but you can call me Veon.

I'm a **Computer Vision Engineer** passionate about building AI systems that *see and understand the world*. I specialize in deep learning, real-time vision applications, and end-to-end model deployment.

Currently diving deep into **CS231n** while applying my skills to real-world projects like safety helmet detection and shelf monitoring with SKU110K.

## 🚀 Projects

🔹 [Helmet Detection AI System](https://github.com/Htet-ThuAung/HelmetDetectionProject)  
-Built with TensorFlow Object Detection API (SSD MobileNetV2), trained on Pascal VOC-style annotations. Real-time inference via webcam and images.

🔹 [CS231n Assignments](https://github.com/Htet-ThuAung/cs231n-assignments)  
-Reimplementing foundational CV algorithms: backprop, CNNs, loss functions, optimization.

🔹 [Habit Tracker (CS50P Final)](https://github.com/Htet-ThuAung/HabitTracker)  
-Simple terminal-based tracker using Python and SQLite — focused on habit consistency.
