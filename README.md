# 👋 Hey, I'm Htet Thu Aung — but you can call me Veon.

I'm a **Computer Vision Engineer** focused on building AI systems that can *see, understand, and act*. My work bridges deep learning research with practical, real-time computer vision applications.

Recently completed the renowned **CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks** course to sharpen my fundamentals, and have since applied those concepts in production-style projects — including helmet detection and shelf-monitoring systems.

## 🚀 Projects

🔹 [Helmet Detection AI System](https://github.com/Htet-ThuAung/HelmetDetectionProject)  
- Built with TensorFlow Object Detection API (SSD MobileNetV2), trained on a custom Pascal VOC-style dataset. Supports real-time webcam and image inference.

🔹 [CS231n Assignments](https://github.com/Htet-ThuAung/cs231n-assignments)  
- Implemented key deep learning components from scratch: backpropagation, loss functions, CNNs, and optimization algorithms.

🔹 [Habit Tracker (CS50P Final)](https://github.com/Htet-ThuAung/HabitTracker)  
- A terminal-based Python application using SQLite, designed for daily habit consistency and personal productivity.

## 🧠 About Me

Based in Yangon 🇲🇲, I’m building a career in Computer Vision through focused learning, project-based mastery, and deep technical exploration. I value clean code, reproducibility, and solving real-world problems with AI.

I thrive on turning ideas into working systems — and the moment when a model *finally converges* after hours of training? That’s my fuel.
